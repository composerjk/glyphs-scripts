glyphs-scripts
==============

Quickly hacked scripts for [Glyphs][] typeface design application.
Install the scripts by copying them into the:
`~/Library/Application Support/Glyphs/Scripts/` directory.
Remember to reload the scripts directory via Option-Shift-Command-Y.

* Audits/check-for-open-paths.py

  Quick hack to display glyphs that have open paths.  Results are displayed
  in the Macro Panel (Option-Command-M).  Works on selected glyphs.  If no
  selection, attempts to check all drawn glyphs (i.e., skips glyphs that
  have no paths in the first glyph layer).  
  Note: Haven't checked if it works with Masters and Instances.
